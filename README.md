Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict insurance charges based on factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region. Using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, the model evaluates how these features impact medical costs. Random Forest Regression performed best with the highest accuracy. Future enhancements include integrating real-time insurance data and deploying the model as a web application for practical use.
